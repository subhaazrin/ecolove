### To test out the app, please follow the setup intstructions below or check out our [Demo](https://youtu.be/U10Paa_e3s8) Video!:

## 1.Requirements

> [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> 
> [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
> 
> [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) *for macOS or Linux users*

*Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended. As Node.js officially states, "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases."*

## 2.Recommended Tools
> [VSCode Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> 
> [VSCode Expo Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=byCedric.vscode-expo) for **app.json** debugging and autocomplete.
> 
> [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
> 
> Windows users: [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows), Command Prompt, Bash via WSL, or the VSCode terminal.

## 3. Download Expo Go App
> 🤖 [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater.
> 
> 🍎 [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) - iOS 11 and greater.

*When the Expo Go app is finished installing, open it up. If you created an account with ```expo-cli``` then you can sign in here on the "Profile" tab. This will make it easier for you to open projects in the client when you have them open in development — they will appear automatically in the "Projects" tab of the client app.*

## 4.Download and Extract Zip.file 
You can download zip.file from Technovation submission or the [github repository](https://github.com/subhaazrin/ecoscan)

## 5.Open your terminal and go to the extracted file in terminal
For me it looks like this on Windows command prompt:
```C:\Users\subha\Downloads\ecoscan\ecoscan>```

## 6.Installing Expo CLI
Enter in terminal:
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```
Verify that the installation was successful by running ```expo whoami```. You're not logged in yet, so you will see "Not logged in". You can create an account by running ```expo register``` if you like, or if you have one already run ```expo login```, but you also don't need an account to get started.

## 7.Install NPM
Enter in terminal:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```

## 8.Run EXPO
Enter in terminal:
```
expo start
```

## 8. Scan the QR code from phone
A QR code should appear that you can scan. It will open the app through the expo go app.
You can also see the app in the 'Projects' section of Expo Go.
