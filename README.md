### To test out the app, please follow the setup intstructions below:

## 1.Requirements

> [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> 
> [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
> 
> [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) *for macOS or Linux users*

*Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended. As Node.js officially states, "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases."*

## 2.Recommended Tools
> [VSCode Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> 
> [VSCode Expo Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=byCedric.vscode-expo) for **app.json** debugging and autocomplete.
> 
> [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
> 
> Windows users: [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows), Bash via WSL, or the VSCode terminal.

## 3.Download and Extract Zip.file from submission or [github repository](https://github.com/subhaazrin/ecoscan)

## 4.Open your terminal and go to the extracted file in terminal
For me it looks like this on Windows command prompt:
```C:\Users\subha\Downloads\ecolove-firebase>```

## 5.Installing Expo CLI
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```
Verify that the installation was successful by running ```expo whoami```. You're not logged in yet, so you will see "Not logged in". You can create an account by running ```expo register``` if you like, or if you have one already run ```expo login```, but you also don't need an account to get started.

## 6.Install NPM
```
npm install
```
```
yarn install
```
